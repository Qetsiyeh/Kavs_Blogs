Ever since I was a little girl, wandering through the fields of Maniyar, life has been an adventure filled with dreams and learning. It all started with the bees. My dad, a farmer with a passion for bee cultivation, always said, "Look at the bees, they hold the secret to life – hard work and discipline." Little did I know, those tiny creatures were setting the stage for my life's journey.

My father was my hero, but when I was just ten, he passed away. It felt like my world had crumbled. But then, my big brother stepped in. He wasn't just my brother; he became my guide, my mentor. He taught me to dream, to imagine a world beyond our fields and bees. His belief in me was unshakeable. "Dream big," he'd say, "and your dreams will take you places." And dream I did.

In my life my mother stands out as the most resilient thread, weaving strength and sacrifice into every moment. After losing my father, our family's world was shaken, and suddenly, she had to embark on a path she never anticipated. She was a housewife, content in the rhythm of our home, but life had other plans. In the face of adversity, she transformed into our unwavering pillar, shouldering responsibilities she never imagined.

Her journey wasn't easy. Finding a job at her age, especially in our small town of Vilappilshala, was like finding a needle in a haystack. But she did it – not just for herself, but for my brother and me. We were her world, and she was determined to see us excel. I was 10, and my brother 14, both studying in high-fee schools. This transition could have been our undoing, but my mother, with her unyielding spirit, turned it into our making.

She treaded through life's storms with a quiet determination that spoke volumes. Her sacrifices were silent but profound. Every day, she faced challenges that would have made many falter, but not her. She worked tirelessly, ensuring that our education and dreams weren't just preserved but nurtured. 

My brother, now a senior software engineer, and I, standing at the precipice of my dream at LSE, are testaments to her incredible strength and love. Her journey was nothing short of heroic, a testament to the power of a mother's love and determination. Without her, our successes would remain unspoken dreams. Her resilience is the cornerstone of our achievements, and every step I take forward is a tribute to her unwavering support and sacrifices.

As my teens progressed, this newfound awareness of the world around me deepened. The more I observed, the more I realized that understanding human behavior was about more than just curiosity; it was about connecting, about making a real difference in the world. My curiosity wasn't just a passing phase; it was turning into a passion. I remember how I tackled a project on waste management in our village. It wasn't just a school project; it was personal. It was about making a difference, about being heard. And guess what? It worked! People listened, changes were made, and that's when I knew – I could bring about change.

Then came the big leap – my entrance into the University of Kerala for my Master's in Economics. Here, I dived into the world of Neuroeconomics. It sounds fancy, doesn't it? But it's all about understanding why we make the choices we do. My project, 'Dop-oxy Marketing,' was a hit! It was about tapping into how our brains work when we make decisions. This was it – I was merging my love for understanding people with science.

Life had another surprise for me – my childhood friend, who turned out to be so much more. We grew up together, shared dreams, and before I knew it, he became my partner in life, my husband. He's been my pillar, standing by me through thick and thin. Together, we've dreamed, we've struggled, but above all, we've grown.

Now, as I stand on the brink of a new adventure at LSE, I can't help but feel a little giddy. It's like all those years of dreaming, learning, and loving have led me to this moment. LSE isn't just a school; it's the realization of a dream, a dream that started with bees and a little girl's curiosity.

My journey isn't just mine. It's a tapestry woven with the love and dreams of my brother, the silent strength of my mother, and the unwavering support of my husband. As I embark on this new chapter, I carry a piece of each of them with me.

To LSE and beyond, I'm ready for the next adventure, ready to learn, ready to dream, and most importantly, ready to make a difference. Here's to dreams coming true and the love that makes it all possible.
