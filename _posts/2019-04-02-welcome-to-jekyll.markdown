Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet, Quantum_Mosaic. This blog is my sanctuary, a place where I unravel my thoughts and curiosities, often inspired by the beauty of nature and the joys of slow living.

My journey in academia, with two masters and an MPhil in Economics and an ongoing pursuit of a PhD, has been enriching and enlightening. Yet, here, at Quantum_Mosaic, I step away from the rigors of academic accolades. This blog isn't about boasting my credentials; it's about exploring beyond them.

As someone who cherishes the simplicity of nature and the art of taking things slow, I find my thoughts often wandering to the mysteries of the human mind, the wonders of quantum cognition, and the intriguing interplay between our brains and our reality. These reflections are not just academic interests; they are part of a larger, more personal quest to understand the world around me and within me.

In this space, I embrace my love for poetry, literature, music, and, of course, my adorable cats. They remind me of the beauty and rhythm in the world â€“ a rhythm that's often overlooked in the hustle of life.

Being a mother to a one-year-old has added a new dimension to my life, teaching me about patience, love, and the profound depths of human connection.

Quantum_Mosaic is my platform to share these musings and discoveries with you. It's a place where academia meets the heart, where science intertwines with the soul. So, take a pause, breathe, and join me in this journey of exploration and expression, at a pace that's just right.
