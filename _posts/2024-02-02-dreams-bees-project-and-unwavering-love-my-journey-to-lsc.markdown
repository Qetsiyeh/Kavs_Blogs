Ever since I was a little girl, wandering through the fields of Maniyar, life has been an adventure filled with dreams and learning. It all started with the bees. My dad, a farmer with a passion for bee cultivation, always said, "Look at the bees, they hold the secret to life – hard work and discipline." Little did I know, those tiny creatures were setting the stage for my life's journey.

My father was my hero, but when I was just ten, he passed away. It felt like my world had crumbled. But then, my big brother stepped in. He wasn't just my brother; he became my guide, my mentor. He taught me to dream, to imagine a world beyond our fields and bees. His belief in me was unshakeable. "Dream big," he'd say, "and your dreams will take you places." And dream I did.

My mother, the quiet strength of our family, was always there, her support unwavering. She never said much, but her eyes always told me, "You can do it." She was my rock, always pushing me forward, especially during those teenage years when I was trying to make sense of the world.

In teens, I started to see the world differently. I noticed things – the way people behaved, how society worked. My curiosity wasn't just a passing phase; it was turning into a passion. I remember how I tackled a project on waste management in our village. It wasn't just a school project; it was personal. It was about making a difference, about being heard. And guess what? It worked! People listened, changes were made, and that's when I knew – I could bring about change.

Then came the big leap – my entrance into the University of Kerala for my Master's in Economics. Here, I dived into the world of Neuroeconomics. It sounds fancy, doesn't it? But it's all about understanding why we make the choices we do. My project, 'Dop-oxy Marketing,' was a hit! It was about tapping into how our brains work when we make decisions. This was it – I was merging my love for understanding people with science.

Life had another surprise for me – my childhood friend, who turned out to be so much more. We grew up together, shared dreams, and before I knew it, he became my partner in life, my husband. He's been my pillar, standing by me through thick and thin. Together, we've dreamed, we've struggled, but above all, we've grown.

Now, as I stand on the brink of a new adventure at LSE, I can't help but feel a little giddy. It's like all those years of dreaming, learning, and loving have led me to this moment. LSE isn't just a school; it's the realization of a dream, a dream that started with bees and a little girl's curiosity.

My journey isn't just mine. It's a tapestry woven with the love and dreams of my brother, the silent strength of my mother, and the unwavering support of my husband. As I embark on this new chapter, I carry a piece of each of them with me.

To LSE and beyond, I'm ready for the next adventure, ready to learn, ready to dream, and most importantly, ready to make a difference. Here's to dreams coming true and the love that makes it all possible.
