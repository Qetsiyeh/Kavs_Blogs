In the quiet hours of the night, when the world around me falls into a deep slumber, I find myself wide awake, tangled in a web of dreams and fears. It's 11 PM, and the comforting rhythm of my uttu's and baby's breathing fills the room with a sense of peace I find elusive. My dream, as vivid and ambitious as it is, keeps me on the edge, teetering between exhilaration and dread. I aspire to be a flying lecturer, soaring from one destination to another, spreading knowledge on neuroeconomics, a field I am deeply passionate about. Yet, as the night deepens, so does my fear of not being able to fulfill this dream.

The idea of becoming a unique professional in my area, someone who brings fresh perspectives to neuroeconomics through classes around the globe, is both thrilling and terrifying. I imagine myself engaging with curious minds, sparking discussions that bridge cultures and disciplines. But as I lie awake, the weight of my aspirations presses down on me, making it hard to breathe, let alone sleep.

One of my immediate goals is to complete a paper on cross-sensory modeling in decision-making under microgravityâ€”a topic that combines my love for neuroeconomics with the thrilling possibilities of space exploration. This paper represents a step towards my dream, a tangible piece of my ambition that I can shape and refine. Yet, the process is daunting, filled with moments of doubt and frustration that often leave me questioning my path.

In pursuit of my dream, I have applied for PhD positions at several universities, each application sent out like a message in a bottle, carrying my hopes across the sea of academia. The London School of Economics (LSE) stands out as my beacon, a place where I believe I can truly expand my knowledge and challenge my limits. The thought of roaming through the LSE libraries, absorbing the wealth of knowledge contained within their walls, and studying until I've satisfied my relentless curiosity, is a vision that both motivates and overwhelms me.

Anxiety has become a constant companion in this journey, a shadow that grows longer with each passing day. The fear of rejection, of not living up to my potential, or of finding that my dreams are just out of reach, haunts me. It whispers doubts into my ear as I try to sleep, painting scenarios of failure and disappointment.

Yet, despite the fear, there's a part of me that knows this is a battle worth fighting. The path to achieving one's dreams is seldom easy or straightforward. It's paved with challenges that test our resolve, our passion, and our willingness to persevere. And perhaps it's in facing these fears head-on that we truly grow, learning not just about our field of interest, but about ourselves.

So, as I lie here, caught between dreams and reality, I choose to believe in the possibility of my ambition. I remind myself that every great journey begins with a single step, fraught with uncertainty but also filled with potential. Yes, the road ahead is daunting, but it's also exhilarating. And perhaps, in the end, it's not just about reaching the destination but about embracing the journey, with all its highs and lows, and finding strength in the knowledge that I dared to dream big.

To all who find themselves awake at night, wrestling with their dreams, know that you're not alone. The path to achieving something extraordinary is often littered with obstacles, but it's also where we find our true resilience. Let's embark on this journey together, supporting each other through the doubts and celebrating each step forward. After all, the world needs dreamers who dare to fly, even when their wings tremble.
